        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! I’m studying Computer Science and working full-time in a cold storage warehouse, which has given me a unique mix of hands-on operations experience and technical problem-solving. A lot of the projects I build come directly from real issues I’ve run into at work, like creating small WMS tools, automations, or dashboards that help make things run smoother.
        </p>

        <p>I enjoy learning new technologies and figuring out how to combine them with warehouse processes. That has pushed me into building full-stack applications, experimenting with .NET and Django, and working on ideas like a slot optimizer, a labor dashboard, and an inbound paperwork automation app. This site is a place for me to share the projects I’ve worked on and keep track of my progress as I grow as a developer.</p>
