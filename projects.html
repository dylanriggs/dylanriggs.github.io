        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>These are a few examples of the work I’ve done as I’ve grown in software development. A lot of what I build comes from real problems I’ve faced in the warehouse world or in my CS projects. I’m always working on something new, so I’ll keep this section updated.</p>

            <h3>Concept Center Platform</h3>
            <p>
                A collaborative class project where my group and I built a full-stack application 
                for managing ideas, projects, and communication inside an innovation center. 
                Users can create projects, assign teammates, post updates, and chat in real time. 
                <br><br>
                I worked on the system architecture, database layer, and the SignalR messaging feature 
                that supports project-specific chatrooms.

            <h3>ASP.NET Core Learning Project (BiteByByte)</h3>
            <p>
                A full-stack web application built during my ASP.NET course, where we 
                followed a structured curriculum and expanded the project with our own 
                custom features. This project helped me learn Razor Pages, dependency 
                injection, Entity Framework Core, and a clean application structure.
                <br><br>
                I added several features beyond the base tutorial, including UI updates, 
                improved form validation, custom database logic, and additional pages 
                that weren't part of the guided instructions.

            <h3>Django Mini WMS</h3>
            <p>
            A basic warehouse management system built in Django that supports creating 
            receipts and bringing inventory into storage. This project helped me model 
            real warehouse workflows and sets the foundation for future features like 
            outbound orders and reporting.
